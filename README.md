# Rubik's Cube solver in Haskell
#### Example cube visualisation generated as SVG file by the program:
![](examples/example-cube.svg)

## Running the project
To solve the cube defined in [example-cube.txt](examples/example-cube.txt) file:
```bash
runhaskell solver.hs examples/example-cube.txt
```
The program will print all rotations made to solve the cube to standard output and will save SVG visualisations for every solving phase in `results/phase$i.svg`. Input cube visualisation will be saved as `results/input.svg`.

## Running tests
```bash
runhaskell Tests.hs
```

## Cube data structure
Data structure representing Rubik's Cube consists of two lists: list of edges (cubies with two colors) and list of corners (cubies with three colors).
Each edge is represented as a pair of two pairs â€“ position of cubie and colors of each face. Anologous to edges, corners are also represented as a pair with position and colors, but both are represented as a 3-tuple.  
Example edge: `((Front,Up), (Yellow, Orange))`  
Example corner: `((Left,Front,Up),  (White, Orange, Blue))`  
See [Cube.hs](Cube.hs) file for type definitions.

## Input file structure
The cube is read from text file as lists of edges and corners colors separated by single empty line. The order of edges/corners is predefined in module `CubeReader` in functions `edgesReadingOrder` and `cornersReadingOrder`. See example input files for a [randomly scrambled](examples/example-cube.txt) cube and [already solved cube](examples/solved-cube.txt).  
Color symbols are: `W` (white - top face), `Y` (yellow - bottom face), `G` (green - left face), `O` (orange - front face), `B` (blue - right face), `R` (red - back face).
